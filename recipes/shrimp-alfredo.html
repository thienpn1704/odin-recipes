    <h1>Shrimp Alfredo</h1>
    <img src="food-images/shrimp-alfredo.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Alfredo is a creamy, dreamy pan sauce made from butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. There are a few additions and adaptations that exist. Unlike béchamel — another classic sauce — Alfredo is best made and eaten straight away. You can use Alfredo for coating broccoli or, most famously, fettuccine.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>Shrimp (I used frozen raw 31-40 count per pound size shrimp. You could use smaller or larger. If using smaller ones, take care not to overcook them)</li>
        <li>Butter (unsalted)</li>
        <li>Cream cheese (for added texture and tangy taste)</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Chicken broth (for added flavor)</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the butter, cream cheese, heavy cream, chicken broth, and garlic to a skillet over medium heat. Cook it for 5 minutes;</li>
        <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese and let it bubble for about a minute;</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp and cook for 5-6 minutes;</li>
        <li>Season to taste and toss with the pasta.</li>
    </ol>
